# DDIA-Study-Notes
This repository contains my personal study notes and interpretations of Martin Kleppmann's 'Designing Data-Intensive Applications'. My goal is to synthesize these complex distributed systems concepts to deepen my understanding by writing documentation as if I am teaching somebody else since you know you fully understand something when you are able to explain it to somebody else.

A quick disclaimer that although I am writing these notes as if they are to be read by somebody else, they are mainly for me and therefore there are a lot of direct quotes or paraphrases from Kelppmann's text that are not properly cited. At the end of the day, copying/paraphrasing what Kleppmann has written is a way for me to best understand these complex topics.

If you do end up reading a majority of my notes, I appreicate it, but these notes are in no way for replacing the actual expereince of reading the textbook itself.
